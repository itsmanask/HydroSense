## 🔧 Key Features & Technical Highlights

- **💧 Water Level Sensor**  
  - Monitors tank levels using a voltage of **3.79V** and current **18mA**, automatically stopping overflow.

- **🌱 Soil Moisture Sensor**  
  - Operates at **3.47V** and **12mA**, activating irrigation when soil moisture drops below a preset threshold.

- **🔋 Power Supply**  
  - Solar-powered with a **9V DC supply** and a battery backup (**3.81V, 2.5Ah**).

- **🧠 Automation**  
  - Relay-based automation (replaced by L298N), cutting off water supply when sensors detect sufficient moisture or full tank capacity.
