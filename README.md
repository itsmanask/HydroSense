## Key Features & Technical Highlights 🔧  

- **💧 Water Level Sensor**:  
   - Monitors tank levels using a voltage of **3.79V** and current **18mA**, automatically stopping overflow.  
- **🌱 Soil Moisture Sensor**:  
   - Operates at **3.47V** and **12mA**, activating irrigation when soil moisture drops below a preset threshold.  
- **🔋 Power Supply**:  
   - Solar-powered with a **9V DC supply** and a battery backup (**3.81V, 2.5Ah**).  
- **🧠 Automation**:  
   - Controlled via relay-based automation, cutting off the water supply when sensors detect sufficient moisture or full tank capacity.
